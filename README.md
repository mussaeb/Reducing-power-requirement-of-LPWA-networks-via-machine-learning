### Documentation/Publication Reference : https://doi.org/10.1556/606.2020.00263


### Support Vector Regression(SVR) and Deep Neural Network(DNN) ML Algorithms are used to reduce, measure and compare power consumption of LPWAN Networks on IoT devices.


## To Run the code :

	pip install -r requirements.txt

	#  Training with SVR: 

		python3 prediction_train.py --model_type='svr'


	# Training with DNN: 

		python3 prediction_train.py --model_type='deepnn'
